        "description": "Dr. Sreekanth V. currently serves as Assistant Professor in Physics, Department of Sciences, School of Engineering, Coimbatore. Dr. Sreekanth is a theoretical physicist and his research is mainly on the properties of hot and/or dense nuclear matter, such as, Quark-Gluon Plasma created in the relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments and cold nuclear matter inside neutron stars. His research has highlighted the effect of dissipation, particularly due to shear and bulk viscosities, on such systems.Prior to joining Amrita, Dr. Sreekanth was a post-doctoral fellow at Center for High Energy Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore (2014-2017). Before that he was pursuing post-doctoral studies at Department of Theoretical Physics, Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai (2012-2014). Dr. Sreekanth obtained his Ph. D. in Theoretical Physics from Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad (2012), where his research work in theoretical high energy nuclear physics had resulted in the thesis- \"Properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions\". He did his postgraduate studies in Physics at IIT Madras.His research areas include Quark-Gluon Plasma, Relativistic Dissipative Hydrodynamics, Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions and Nuclear Astrophysics.Dr. Sreekanth also has an academic interest in many aspects of Indology.Profile: Sreekanth V."
