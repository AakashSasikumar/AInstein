# AInstein

AInstein is a virtual assistant that is aimed at helping students through collaboration.

## Installation

First we need to install the dependencies

```
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install tflearn
pip install nltk
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
pip install --upgrade gensim
```

To be able to stem words and tokenize them, we need to download additional dependencies that nltk requires. Start a python environment and type these commands.
```
import nltk
nltk.download("all")
```
